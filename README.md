# MimikaStudio - Local-First Voice Cloning

> *I ported my old Gradio app into this beautiful native Flutter desktop application, specifically optimized for Apple Silicon users who want a polished, responsive UI with proper macOS integration.*

**MimikaStudio is the most comprehensive desktop application for voice cloning and text-to-speech synthesis.** Whether you want to clone your own voice from just 3 seconds of audio, use one of 9 premium preset speakers, or leverage fast high-quality TTS engines for narration and content creation - MimikaStudio has you covered.

## Why MimikaStudio?

MimikaStudio brings together the latest advances in neural text-to-speech into a beautiful, unified desktop experience:

### Lightning-Fast British TTS with Kokoro

Need instant, high-quality speech? **[Kokoro TTS](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro)** delivers sub-200ms latency with crystal-clear British and American accents. The 82M parameter model runs effortlessly on any machine, generating natural-sounding speech with Emma, George, Lily, and other premium voices. Perfect for real-time applications, PDF narration, and quick prototyping.

Kokoro also includes **Emma IPA** - a British phonetic transcription tool powered by your choice of LLM (Claude, OpenAI, Ollama). Generate IPA transcriptions to understand exactly how words should be pronounced in Received Pronunciation.

### Voice Cloning Without Limits

Clone any voice from remarkably short audio samples. Our **[Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS)** integration requires just **3 seconds** of reference audio to capture a speaker's characteristics - their tone, rhythm, accent, and personality. Compare this to older systems that required 30+ seconds of clean recordings. Upload a voice memo, a podcast clip, or any audio snippet, and MimikaStudio will synthesize new speech in that voice.

### Premium Preset Speakers

Don't have reference audio? No problem. MimikaStudio includes **9 premium preset speakers** across 4 languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean), each with distinct personalities - from the dynamic rhythm of Ryan to the warm emotional tones of Sohee. These CustomVoice speakers require no audio samples at all - just type your text and generate.

### Multiple State-of-the-Art Models

We've integrated the most capable open-source TTS models available:

| Model | Type | Strength |
|-------|------|----------|
| **[Kokoro-82M](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro)** | Fast TTS | Sub-200ms latency, British RP & American accents |
| **[Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS) 0.6B/1.7B Base** | Voice Cloning | 3-second cloning, 10 languages |
| **[Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS) 0.6B/1.7B CustomVoice** | Preset Speakers | 9 premium voices, style control |
| **XTTS2** | Multi-language Cloning | 16 languages, proven quality |

### Beyond Simple TTS

MimikaStudio isn't just a TTS engine wrapper:

- **Emma IPA Transcription**: Generate British IPA-like phonetic transcriptions using LLM providers (Claude, OpenAI, Ollama). Perfect for language learning and pronunciation guides.

- **PDF Reader with Voice**: Load any PDF from the `./pdf` directory and have it read aloud with sentence-by-sentence highlighting. Choose your preferred Kokoro voice, adjust speed, and let MimikaStudio narrate your documents.

![PDF Reader with TTS](assets/03-pdf-reader.png)

- **Unified Voice Library**: All your custom voice samples (XTTS and Qwen3) in one unified list. Upload once, use with either engine.

- **Advanced Generation Controls**: Fine-tune every aspect of synthesis with temperature, top_p, top_k, repetition penalty, and reproducible generation with seeds.

- **Style Instructions**: Tell the CustomVoice speakers *how* to speak - "whisper softly", "speak with excitement", "sound contemplative" - and watch the AI adapt.

- **Real-time System Monitoring**: CPU, RAM, and GPU usage displayed in the app header so you always know what resources your generations are consuming.

- **Multi-LLM Support**: Connect to Claude, OpenAI, Ollama (local), or Claude Code CLI for IPA generation and other AI features.

### Built for macOS, Ready for More

MimikaStudio has been **extensively tested on macOS** (both Intel and Apple Silicon). It's our primary platform, with careful attention to MPS acceleration where supported and graceful CPU fallback where needed. The architecture cleanly separates the **Flutter-based UI** from the **Python FastAPI backend**, making adaptation to Linux or Windows with CUDA straightforward.

### Production-Quality Codebase

This isn't a weekend hack:

- **Comprehensive test suite** with 11 test files covering health checks, API generation, voice management, model registry, streaming endpoints, and end-to-end workflows
- **MCP server integration** for programmatic access via Codex CLI
- **Clean CLI tool** (`mimikactl`) for service management, logs, and maintenance
- **Modular engine architecture** making it easy to add new TTS backends
